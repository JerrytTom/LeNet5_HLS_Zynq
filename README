It does not matter if you can make your project. 

I give some Question and Answer.
Q: How can you train this model ?
A: I trained the LeNet-5 model using Tiny-DNN. Extract the weight from Tiny-DNN and Run this implementation on Zynq. But weights in this project is not trained model. So You should train LeNet-5 model and extract weights from DNN Framkeworks.

Q: In your paper, the upper loop is applied by Pipeline and the lower loop is applied Unroll. But it is impossible in SDSoC. How can you do that ?
A: In SDSoC tool, Pipeline includes not only the pipeline technique, but also loop unrolling. If you apply a pipeline to the upper part and make it unroll well internally, both the pipeline and unroll apply.
